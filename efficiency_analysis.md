# Efficiency Analysis: Manual vs AI Implementation

## Performance Comparison
- **Manual Implementation**: Uses bubble sort algorithm with O(nÂ²) time complexity
- **AI Implementation**: Uses Python's built-in `sorted()` with Timsort (O(n log n))

## Key Findings:
1. **Readability**: AI version is more Pythonic and concise
2. **Performance**: AI implementation significantly faster for large datasets
3. **Maintainability**: Built-in functions have better error handling
4. **Best Practices**: AI follows Python conventions more closely

## Conclusion:
The AI-suggested implementation is superior in all aspects...
